## Description

### `GalleryItemProps`

## Behaviour

- The `MasonryGallery` component arranges images in a neat grid, with alternating large and small square images.
- Each image is rendered using the `GalleryItem` component, ensuring consistent display of images.
- The grid pattern is formed by repeating large and small square images, creating a dynamic and visually appealing layout.
- Optionally, overlay text can be displayed on top of the image. The display mode of the overlay can be controlled with the `overlayDisplay` prop (`"hover"` or `"static"`).
- The gallery adapts dynamically to the available space, with the images arranged into the grid pattern.
